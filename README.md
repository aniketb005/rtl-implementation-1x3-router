# RTL Design and Implementation of 1x3 Router

This Project was created in 2017. It contains RTL Implementation of a basic Router1x3 (Single Ingress, 3 Egress Ports).
It is designed accepts data packets on a single 8-bit port and routes them to one of the three output ports.

Following points were covered while completing this project.
1. Designed a the block level structure for the Router.
2. Implemented the RTL Design using Verilog HDL and verified using individual verilog testbenches.
3. Developed the class based verification environment using SystemVerilog.
4. Verified the RTL model of Router1x3 using SystemVerilog. Here, Testbench Methodology used here is UVM.
5. Generated functional and code coverage for the RTL verification sign-off.
6. Synthesized the design.
